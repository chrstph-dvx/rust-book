- Parenthesis unnecessary for `if`
- Variables can be assigned with if, if both assignemnt are of the same type:
  `let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };`

# Loop

- Loop can be nammed to reference them with break/continue: `'counting_up: loop { ... }` (only opening `'`)
- Loop can return value: `break returnValue`;
